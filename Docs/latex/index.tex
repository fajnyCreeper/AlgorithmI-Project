 The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_math_formula}{Math\+Formula}} class uses {\itshape Shunting Yard} algorithm to create post fix notation format. Then by utilizing algorithm for solving post fix notation, it calculates the result of the formula.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Notes}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The program was made to work with following operators (separated by spaced)\+: {\ttfamily + -\/ $\ast$ / ( ) $^\wedge$} ~\newline

\item This solution expects only valid formulas using numbers and the operators listed above.
\item The main function contains pre-\/defined set of example formulas. When executing, the program will calculate the formulas and print them to console including the results.
